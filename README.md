# DroneFlyingVR
## Description
A futuristic remote-controlled drone flying experience where you can fly your drone around a map with obstacles and targets to shoot with a turret. The player will be stationary and will have a virtual controller to fly the drone and do tricks such as backflips. The player will be able to put on a virtual headset that allows them to see from the drone's camera. The area underneath the drone will have the effects of it being blown away. If the drone collides with another object, depending on the severity, it will have effects on the drone, such as slower speed and damage done.
